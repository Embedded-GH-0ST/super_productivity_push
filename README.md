# ProjectTsukumo | Embedded-GH-0ST 👻

## 🚀 Overview
This repository is part of the **GH-0ST** distributed hive-mind system. The `super_productivity_push` module is designed to streamline development workflows and automate repetitive data engineering tasks. 

This project serves as a central hub for testing node scripts and managing the "productivity" logic of the GH-0ST ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Environment:** Windows 11 + WSL2 (Ubuntu)
- **Version Control:** Git
- **IDE:** Google Anti-Gravity

## 🤖 Modules & Files
- `TEST.py`: Core script for testing node connectivity and productivity benchmarks.
- `README.md`: System documentation and project roadmap.

## 📈 Data Engineering Goals
As I transition into Data Engineering and prepare for my Computer Science degree, this project focuses on:
1. **Pipeline Automation:** Scripting tasks to reduce manual overhead.
2. **Distributed Architecture:** Understanding how different nodes (like GH-0ST) communicate.
3. **Professional Workflow:** Maintaining high standards for version control and documentation.
